Full-cycle machine learning with Python 

NLP files take an unstructured document, read the text, remove the punctuation and stopwords, tokenize the data, stem it and lemmatize it
into a final dataframe which is then used to build and compare the performance of several different ensemble machine learning models e.g. 
random forest and gradient boost.   N-grams, count tokenizer, and TFIDF NLP approaches are compared, and grid search with k = 5-fold validation
is used.    Target variable being predicted is binary -- whether each text message is "spam" or "ham" .

Google Collab "Copy of..." files include the full scale of data science and machine learning, from explanatory data analysis (EDA) to data visualization 
to feature engineering and machine learning model training and testing.   Regression and classification models are both built, as well as Autogluon models.   
Finally, model optimization by way of various grid search hyperparameter tuning approaches is included.    

Thanks and enjoy!
